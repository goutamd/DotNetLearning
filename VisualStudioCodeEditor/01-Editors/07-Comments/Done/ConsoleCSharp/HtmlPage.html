	<h2>Tired of writing XAML shaders in primitive text editors?</h2>
	<div class="demo">

		<p>
			Shazzam is the top rated third party shader editor for XAML developers.  Say goodbye to your text editors or buggy   Visual Studio templates.  Use a tool that is actually fun to use, practical and loaded with free shader samples.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are a Silverlight or WPF developer you've probably heard about pixel shaders.
    In fact, you may be using some of these effects in your application already. WPF
    introduced the DropShadowEffect and BlurEffect in .NET 3.5 SP1 and both of these
    classes take advantage of pixel shaders. Silverlight has similar classes. The Expression
    Blend team added dozens of new shader effects to their latest release.<br />
			You
    can write your own shaders and add them to your project. But there isn't a lot of
    tooling support from Microsoft.
		</p>
		<p>That's why I created Shazzam. </p>
